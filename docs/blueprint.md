# **App Name**: 3D Print Price Pal

## Core Features:

- Parameter Input and Calculation: Allow users to input 3D printing parameters such as job name, currency, file upload, printing time, filament weight, filament type, spool price, and spool weight, just as described in the user's example. Calculate total filament cost based on user inputs. Show the inputs shown in the provided screenshots and description.
- Labor Cost Input: Enable users to input labor costs, including preparation time and cost per hour, post-processing time and cost per hour, and a total labor cost.
- Maintenance Costs (Optional): Provide an optional section for machine maintenance costs. Provide an "optional" toggle as requested in the user prompt. Hide the maintenance costs by default, unless this option is selected by the user.
- Additional Costs Input: Enable users to add other costs, including item name and price, with a button to add more cost lines.
- Final Price Calculation: Calculate and display the final price, taking into account profit percentage and VAT (including a field to enter the percentage).
- Sharing and Printing: Add buttons to share the calculator data and print a summary, enabling easy sharing and record-keeping.
- AI-Powered Parameter Extraction: Incorporate a tool where the user uploads the GCODE and the system automatically inputs parameters for filament weight and printing time to save time and improve accuracy.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust, efficiency, and technological sophistication, evoking the precision of 3D printing.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), a desaturated tint of the primary, which will minimize distraction.
- Accent color: A contrasting warm orange (#FF9933) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for all other text.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different input fields and actions.
- Employ a clean, structured layout that arranges input fields logically.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback upon data entry and calculation.
